I’m a PhD Candidate in Ecology at UC Davis, in the [Karban](https://karban.wordpress.com/) and [Holyoak](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/holyoak/) labs. I did my M.S. in the [Elkinton](https://elkintonlab.wordpress.com/) lab at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and a Fulbright fellowship with [Birchmoth](http://www.birchmoth.no/) at University of Tromsø and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. I’m currently an (informal) visiting scholar with [Jenny Cory](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/people/profiles/jsc21.html) at Simon Fraser University and Judy Myers at University of British Columbia.

I’m interested broadly in plant-insect population & community ecology, especially in the context of climate change. I also have an interest in the ecology and biological control of invasive insects.
