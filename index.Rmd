I am currently employed as a biologist doing stream ecology work for the state of Maine.  Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [ Uricchio lab](https://uricchio.github.io/) at Tufts University. I did my PhD in Ecology at UC Davis, in the [Karban](https://karban.wordpress.com/) and [Holyoak](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/holyoak/) labs, my M.S. in the [Elkinton](https://elkintonlab.wordpress.com/) lab at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and a Fulbright fellowship with [Birchmoth](http://www.birchmoth.no/) at University of Tromsø and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. 

I’m interested broadly in insect population & community ecology, especially in the context of climate change. I also have an interest in the ecology and biological control of invasive insects.
