<p>My research interests are broad ranging in population and community
ecology. However, much of my work focuses around themes of leveraging
ecological theory, quantitative methods and field data to understand the
effects of climate change and invasion on population and community
dynamics. One of my core research aims is to develop new ecological
theory to these ends. My research interests can be organized into a few
general areas:</p>
<p><strong>Climate change &amp; population dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Climate change has broad ranging impacts on nature, from an ant that
forages more quickly in warmer temperatures to droughts that transform
plant communities. These different outcomes are causally connected
through impacts on individuals and populations. However, the diversity
and complexity of the natural world make it difficult to resolve causal
connections and predict how climate change will affect ecological
communities. Ecological theories developed about how geographic ranges
are controlled, and how changes in populations are controlled by
interactions such as competition, predation, and herbivory offer the
basis to develop theory that is explicitly focused on understanding the
potential effects of climate change.</p>
<p>For example, populations are influenced by both a) biotic
interactions such as competition and disease, caused by high population
densities, and b) environmental conditions such as drought stress. The
interplay between these two forces can result in a complex relationship
between climate change and population dynamics. Using time series data
collected over 35 years, I found that changing rainfall patterns in
California interacted with disease dynamics in a population of
caterpillars, resulting in a transition from non-cyclic to cyclic
dynamics (1)⁠. Populations may also be differentially influenced by
climate change depending on the current local climate. For example,
based on range limit theory, I predicted that woolly bear caterpillar
populations are more likely to be affected by climate change-induced
droughts via host plant limitation in the southern part of the species
range relative to their northern counterpart. Preliminary results from
both observational and experimental studies suggest that droughts affect
southern populations by reducing the food quality of caterpillars’ host
plants. In contrast, northern populations are likely more limited by
viral infection or insufficient warmth during the growing season.</p>

<small> Figure 1. Schematic diagram of community traits that inﬂuence
the relative importance of direct versus indirect effects of warming on
interactions between prey (blue) and predators (red). Large asymmetries
in thermal niches will result in larger indirect effects of warming (a),
whereas symmetric thermal niches will result in larger direct effects
(b). Asymmetries in thermal responses between prey and predators and
thus the relative magnitude of indirect versus direct effects depend on
multiple aspects of the predator community thermal niche. Our results
suggest that high diversity (c), narrow thermal niche breadth (d),
correspondence between the community mean thermal optimum and prey
thermal optimum (e), and an even predator species abundance distribution
(f) will result in weaker indirect effects versus direct effects of
warming. From Pepi and McMunn 2021, <em>Am. Nat.</em></small>

</div>
<p><strong>Temperature and predator-prey interactions</strong></p>
<p>Research has shown that climate warming affects ectotherm metabolic
rate (2)⁠, resulting in greater activity, growth, feeding, and attack
rates with higher temperatures (3)⁠. This has the potential to change
the outcomes of predator-prey interactions through relative effects of
warming on predator and prey activity rates, growth rates, and attack
rates, leading to strong indirect effects on prey survival of warming
through changing interactions (4)⁠. I have investigated the effect of
warming on predator-prey interactions that are dependent on life stage.
An increase in warming leads to two opposing effects: the window at
which prey are most vulnerable is reduced due to shortened development
time, but predators increase their attack rates. In this situation,
whether warming benefits predators or prey depends on predator-prey
thermal asymmetries (5).</p>
<p>I have also developed a theoretical model to examine
temperature-dependent predator-prey interactions in multi-predator
communities. Nearly all previous empirical work examining warming
effects on predator-prey interactions has considered single
predator-prey pairs, even though most prey species interact with
multiple predator species. Using this model, I found that prey species
interacting with multiple predators are less likely to experience strong
asymmetries in thermal response rates (e.g., attack rate, growth rate)
relative to predators, versus prey species interacting with fewer
predators. This effect attenuates the indirect effects of warming due to
predator-prey interactions on prey survival (6)⁠. This attenuation
effect found in simulations depends on predator diversity, and thermal
niche complementarity of predators, in which the thermal niches of
predators are sufficiently different (i.e., low niche overlap; Figure
1). Several other aspects of the predator community thermal niche may
influence the attenuating effect of predator diversity (see Figure
1).</p>

Ranchman’s tiger moth (<em>Arctia virginalis</em>) on yellow bush lupine

increases infection levels in the current year, due to viral occlusion
bodies left by cadavers. However, host plant chemistry might reduce
infection in the current year, while ultraviolet radiation reduces
infection in subsequent year by inactivating viral occlusion bodies.

<p><strong>Host-baculovirus dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Insect viruses are key factors in the the dynamics of many insect
populations, driving cycles of many forest pests (8)⁠. Beyond the basic
tendency of many pathogens to drive cyclic dynamics, pathogens interact
with a host of local factors that ultimately generate observed
population dynamics. In line with this complexity, models of disease
dynamics in Lepidoptera show that host-pathogen dynamics can vary
greatly depending on multiple parameter values in models, such as those
representing viral persistence, predation, population growth, and
dispersal (9–11).</p>
<p>I have been conducting research into the question of how spatial
variation in population drivers affects host-baculovirus dynamics in
Ranchman’s tiger moth (Arctia virginalis), using empirical research and
mathematical modelling. At a broad scale, we have found that higher
ultraviolet radiation results in lower infection severity and higher
survival rate, likely due to infection with lower doses of virus, due to
inactivation of virus by UV (Figure 2; 12)⁠.</p>
<p>At a more local scale, we have found that caterpillars in wet habitat
patches are infected at higher levels than caterpillars in dry patches,
which could be driven by either differences between viral persistence in
the environment, or differences in average population density. These
differences in infection levels result in different cyclic dynamics
between wet an dry patches, with dry patches having much higher
amplitude oscillations (Pepi et al., unpublished). In continuing work,
we are interested in determining the mechanisms for wet-dry site
differences in dynamics, and developing theoretical models to help
understand how dispersal linkages between patches affect host-pathogen
dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Ecology &amp; management of invasive forest
pests</strong></p>
<p>Invasive forest insects have become an increasing problem in North
America (13)⁠, particularly in the Northeastern states. For some species
– such as the Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly–
eradication is still the primary control method (14)⁠. Other species –
such as emerald ash borer, hemlock wooly adelgid, gypsy moth, and winter
moth – have become well established and other methods, such as
biological control, are more appropriate. The effectiveness of
biological control, through bio-pesticides (BT, viral isolates) or
natural enemy importation, depends on an understanding of the
determinants of pest population dynamics. I have investigated forces
regulating winter moth populations in both the invasive and native
range. I found that populations were controlled by host plant limitation
and dispersal in the invasive range in New England (15)⁠, and by bird
predation in the native range in Norway (16)⁠. This, along with other
work, supported the potential efficacy of implementing biological
control for winter moth, which has ultimately been successful in New
England (17)⁠.</p>
